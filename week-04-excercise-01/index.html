        <h1>My Dev Tools Vandalism</h1>
        <p>
            I used browser developer tools to temporarily "vandalize" a
            website. Below is a screenshot showing my changes. These edits
            only appeared on my computer and did not affect the actual
            website.
        </p>
        <div class="screenshot-container">
            <!-- 
                IMPORTANT: Update the src attribute below to match your screenshot filename.
                Example: If your screenshot is named "apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png", change the line to:
                src="./apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png"
            -->
            <img src="EDITEDFOX.png" alt="Screenshot of the webpage I vandalized" />
        </div>
        <h2>What I "Vandalized"</h2>
        <p>
            Describe the changes you made to the website using the browser's developer tools. Some potential questions
            to consider:
        <ul>
            <li>What text did you edit?
                - I edited the headline of the article 
            </li>
            <li>What CSS properties did you modify?
                - I changed the color of the article box and the padding in the page
            </li>
            <li>What made your edits interesting or amusing?
                - I think the headline is amusing and the color is jarring because fox is not usually yellow
            </li>
            <li>Did you understand why some changes worked and some didn't?
                - Somewhat. I had a little bit of trouble navigating the inspect elements and couldn't exactly figure out where the CSS changes were made
            </li>
            <li>Why did you choose the changes you did?
                - It seemed like something that was challenging enough but still simple to give me something to latch on to
            </li>
            <li>Were you able to understand how the HTML and CSS worked together to make the changes you made?
                - Yes, through this course and the last one I am beginning to udnerstand how HTML and CSS interact
            </li>
            <li>Do you think you have a better sense of how dev tools can be used while crafting your own webpages?
                - I don't think I exactly have what I need to be proficient but I think that I am starting to understand the things that can be done.
            </li>
        </ul>

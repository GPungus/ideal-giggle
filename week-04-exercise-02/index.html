            This is a collection of things that I believe to be important. In my collection you will see an assortment of media, places, and things that bring me comfort, and are things that I would like to share with the world, If I could talk about only some things for the rest of my life, it would probably be these things. My collection is a small glimpse into who I am, my interests, my hobbies, and maybe you will find some similarities between the two of us as you delve into my assortment of items.

                <h2>Lateralus</h2>
                <p class="details">Album | 2001 | TOOL </p>
                <p class="description">
                    Lateralus is TOOL's 4th studio album and is one of their most coveted albums amongst both fans and critics. The album released in 2001 and quickly ushered in a new era of TOOL as they delved deeper into the themes of spirituality and divinity. Lateralus is hands down my favorite album from TOOL and helped me reshape my world view entirely. At the time I was struggling with existentialism, and the thematic elements in this album brought me a level of comfort that I couldn't seem to find before. I recommend this album to anybody that enjoys basking in the anticipation and is interested in experiencing the single greatest transition between songs ever added to an album.

                    Dark Souls and it's related titles are notoriously some of the most difficult games that are sold on the market. There is a debate to be had as to what constitutes as difficulty, but most people that play video games will agree these games are difficult. Dark Souls III was my first entry into the series, and while I hated it at first, I came to love the atmosphere, the story being told, and the possibility to persevere. The difficulty in the game really comes from the perseverence that is required to overcome some of the things that this game will throw at you. Since playing these games, I have not yet found something that recreates the feeling of beating a boss that I stayed up all night trying to beat. Maybe I should turn to drug usage? (JOKING!!!)

                <p class="details">Movie | 2010 | David Fincher</p>
                <p class="description">
                    The Social Network is my favorite movie that I have seen. I have not watched many movies, but of the ones that I have seen, this is the top dog. I think the cinematography in the film is second to none, especially for the time period that it was made. I believe this to be the best acting performance that Andrew Garfield has delivered, and the rest of the cast puts it together phenomenally. I recommend this movie for anyone that is remotely interested in the origin story of Facebook, and doubly to anyone that likes Jesse Eisenberg. He is fantastic in this film.

                <p class="description">
                    There is not much to be said about One Piece that has not already been said by someone much smarter and much better looking than I am. Nonetheless, One Piece is my favorite Anime and one that I feel is the undisputed best in it's genre. The world building in One Piece is so incredible that I think even people who traditionally do not like anime would enjoy some of the stories and plotlines within One Piece. Yes, it is ridiculously long, but it is also ridiculously worth it. No one is asking you to binge it in a week! Give it a try!

                <p class="details">Franchise | 1991 | SEGA </p>
                <p class="description">
                    Sonic is my favorite franchise, be it video game, movie, show or comic. Released in 1991, at one point the Blue Blur was going toe to toe with Mario in both sales and relevancy. After a series of terrible decisions by SEGA spearheaded by rushed development timelines and a general lack of competence, Sonic fell into the shadows and became the laughing stock of, well, everything. Notwithstanding, people like me have continued to support the franchise in hopes that one day SEGA will be able to figure themselves out. For now, we're really happy with Sonic Racing Crossworlds.

                <p class="description">
                    The 24 Hours of Daytona is a race that I go to yearly, primarily because I have free lodging with my friend and it is increibly cheap as far as motorsport events go. The entire spectacle is something to behold, and even just walking into the infield of the track and seeing the masssive grandstands in the distance is breathtaking. Being amongst the noise and some of the best drivers in the world, its hard not to be excited.
